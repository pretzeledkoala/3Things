<h1>Calabi-Yau 3-fold</h1>
<definition>
<p>A <strong>Calabi–Yau 3-fold</strong> is a complex, compact, Kähler manifold of real dimension 6 that has a vanishing first Chern class. </p>
<p>The Chern class condition is implied by any of the following (equivalent) conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The canonical bundle of $M$ is trivial.</li>
<li>$M$ has a holomorphic $n$-form that vanishes nowhere.</li>
<li>The structure group of the tangent bundle of $M$ can be reduced from $U(3)$, the unitary group, to $SU(3)$, the special unitary group.</li>
<li>$M$ has a Kähler metric with global holonomy contained in $SU(3)$.</li>
</ol>
</definition>
<h1>Fukaya Category</h1>
<definition>
<p>The <strong>Fukaya category</strong> of a symplectic manifold $(X,\omega)$ is a category $\mathcal{F}(X)$ whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of $X$ and morphisms are Lagrangian Floer chain groups: $\text{Hom}(L_0, L_1)=CF(L_0, L_1)$.</p>
</definition>
<h1>Foliations</h1>
<p>A <strong>foliation</strong> is a geometric structure on a manifold that describes how the manifold can be "split" or "partitioned" into a collection of lower-dimensional submanifolds called leaves. Intuitively, a foliation organizes the manifold into a family of submanifolds, each of which looks locally like a Euclidean space.</p>
<p>Rigorously:</p>
<definition>
<p>Let $M$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $n$, and let $D$ be a smooth distribution on $M$, i.e., a smooth assignment of a subspace of $T_p M$ (the tangent space at each point $p \in M$) for each point in $M$. A <strong>foliation</strong> is a decomposition of $M$ into a collection of disjoint, smooth submanifolds, called <strong>leaves</strong>, such that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Local Trivialization:
For each point $p \in M$, there exists a neighborhood $U \subset M$ of $p$, and coordinates on $U$ (called <strong>leaf coordinates</strong>) such that the leaves of the foliation locally look like the product of a lower-dimensional Euclidean space with the remaining coordinates. More precisely, if the leaves are $k$-dimensional, there is a smooth map from $U$ to $\mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ that maps the leaves to $\mathbb{R}^k \times { 0 }$, while preserving the smooth structure of the foliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrability Condition:
The distribution $D$ is <strong>integrable</strong>, meaning that for any two vector fields $X, Y$ in the distribution, their Lie bracket $[ X, Y ]$ is also in the distribution. This condition ensures that locally through every point there exists a smooth $k$-dimensional submanifold, tangent to $D$, that forms a leaf of the foliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codimension:
The <strong>codimension</strong> of the foliation is the difference between the dimension of the manifold and the dimension of the leaves. If the leaves are $k$-dimensional, then the foliation has codimension $n - k$. The dimension of the leaves is often referred to as the <strong>leaf dimension</strong>, and the codimension is the dimension of the <strong>transverse space</strong> (the space orthogonal to the leaves).</p>
