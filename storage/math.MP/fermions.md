# Vertex Operator Algebra

<definition>

A **vertex operator algebra** is a tuple $(V, Y, \mathbf{1}, \omega)$ where:

1. $V$ is a graded vector space $V = \bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} V_n$, where $V_n$ is the space of states of degree $n$, and $V_0$ typically contains the vacuum state.

2. $Y$ is a **vertex operator map** $Y: V \times V \to \text{End}(V)$, which satisfies the following:
   - For any $a \in V$, there is a map $Y(a, z)$ called the vertex operator, which is a formal power series in $z$:
     $$
     Y(a, z) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} a_n z^{-n-1},
     $$
     where $a_n \in \text{End}(V)$ are operators acting on the vector space $V$.

3. **Vacuum vector $\mathbf{1}$**: There exists a special element $\mathbf{1} \in V$ called the vacuum vector, which acts as a "neutral element" under the vertex operator algebra structure. This element satisfies:
   - $Y(\mathbf{1}, z) = \text{id}_V$ (the identity operator) when acting on any $v \in V$.
   - The vacuum vector is the unique element such that $Y(\mathbf{1}, z) v = v$ for all $v \in V$.

4. **Conformal vector $\omega$**: There is a special element $\omega \in V_2$ (often called the **conformal vector**), which governs the action of the Virasoro algebra. The Virasoro operators $L_n$ are defined in terms of the vertex operators:
   $$
   Y(\omega, z) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} L_n z^{-n-2}.
   $$
   The conformal vector $\omega$ satisfies the **vacuum condition**:
   - $L_n \mathbf{1} = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$ (the vacuum is annihilated by positive modes of the Virasoro algebra).
   - The Virasoro generators $L_n$ satisfy the **Virasoro algebra** commutation relations:

    $$
     [L_m, L_n] = (m-n) L_{m+n} + \frac{c}{12} (m^3 - m) \delta_{m+n, 0},
    $$
     where $c$ is the central charge.

satisfying the following properties:

- **Grading**: The vector space $V$ is graded by $\mathbb{Z}$ and contains a distinguished vacuum vector.
- **Operator product expansion (OPE)**: The vertex operators have a well-defined operator product expansion, providing a way to multiply vertex operators.
- **Commutativity and locality**: The vertex operators satisfy certain commutation relations that encode locality in the quantum field theory context.
- **Conformal symmetry**: The Virasoro algebra, generated by the conformal vector $\omega$, encodes the symmetries of the theory, particularly the infinitesimal conformal transformations in two dimensions.

There are many sources for VOAs, such as:

- free field VOA
- associated to a Lie superalgebra 
- from the Virasoro algebra
- orbifolds
- cosets
- $\mathcal{W}$ algebras
