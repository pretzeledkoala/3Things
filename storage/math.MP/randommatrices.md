# Hyperbolic Geometry 

We can use random matrix theory to solve problems in hyperbolic geometry, using random walks on graphs as an intermediary step. 

# Operators and Free Probability
Large chunks of random matrix theory was discovered by people studying operators (in particular, the $C^*$-algebra and von Neumann algebra cases), and free probability was a tool developed to do this.

# Representation Theory  

Random matrix theory can be used to study representation theory problems through Ramanujan graphs.
