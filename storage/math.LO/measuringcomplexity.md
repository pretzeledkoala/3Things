# Difficulty of Classification Problem For Torsion-Free Abelian Groups

The classification problem for the torsion-free abelian groups of rank $n\ge 2$ is geniunely harder than the classiciation problem for rank $n=1$, which can be partially answered using descriptive set theory and superrigidity theory.
