# Calabi-Yau 3-fold 

A Calabi–Yau 3-fold is a complex, compact, Kähler manifold of real dimension 6 that has a vanishing first Chern class. 

The Chern class condition is implied by any of the following (equivalent) conditions:

1. The canonical bundle of $M$ is trivial.
2. $M$ has a holomorphic $n$-form that vanishes nowhere.
3. The structure group of the tangent bundle of $M$ can be reduced from $U(3)$, the unitary group, to $SU(3)$, the special unitary group.
4. $M$ has a Kähler metric with global holonomy contained in $SU(3)$.
