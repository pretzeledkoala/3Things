# Poincare Polynomial 

Let $H_q(X)$ denote the $q$-th homology group of the topological space $X$. The **Betti number** $\beta_q(X)$ of the space is defined as the rank (the number of independent generators) of the homology group $H_q(X)$, i.e.:

$$
\beta_q(X) = \text{rank}(H_q(X))
$$

The **Poincar√© polynomial** $P_X(x)$ of $X$ is then given by:

$$
P_X(x) = \sum_{q=0}^{\infty} \beta_q(X) x^q
$$

where $\beta_q(X)$ is the Betti number for the $q$-th homology group, and $x$ is a formal variable.

# Cohen-Macauley Rings

A **Cohen-Macaulay ring** is a commutative ring $R$ such that the depth of $R$ is equal to its Krull dimension. 

Here are the two relevant terms: 
- **Krull dimension** of $R$ is the length of the longest chain of prime ideals in $R$.
- **Depth** of $R$ is the length of the longest regular sequence of elements in the ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of maximal ideals of $R$. A regular sequence is a sequence of elements $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ such that each $x_i$ is not a zero divisor on the quotient ring $R/(x_1, \dots, x_{i-1})$, and $x_1$ is not a zero divisor in $R$.

This condition implies certain nice homological properties for the ring.

Example: polynomial rings $k[x_1,...,x_n]$

# Abelian Varieties 

An **abelian variety** is a **complete**, **smooth**, **projective algebraic variety** $A$ defined over an algebraically closed field $k$ (often taken to be $\mathbb{C}$ or $\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}$) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Group structure**: There is a **group law** on $A$, i.e., there is a map
   $$
   \mu: A \times A \to A
   $$
   that satisfies the usual group axioms (associativity, existence of identity, and inverse).

2. **Commutativity**: The group law on $A$ is **commutative**; this means for all points $P, Q \in A$, we have $P + Q = Q + P$, where $+$ denotes the group operation.

3. **Smoothness**: $A$ is a smooth variety, meaning it has no singularities (its tangent space is well-behaved everywhere).

4. **Completeness**: $A$ is a complete variety, meaning it satisfies the **Chow's condition**: every morphism from a complete variety to $A$ factors through a compactification of $A$.

Examples: elliptic curves, Jacobians of curves, complex tori, etc.
